This library implements primatives for the epochal time model as defined in the Clojure programming language. These primatives are useful for creating concurrent code that is easy to reason about. See [Are we there yet?](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Are-We-There-Yet-Rich-Hickey) for details on this model.
